# Accreted Milky Way Globular Clusters

**Objectives**

Using data from the Harris Catalogue of Milky Way globular clusters and vandenBerg et al. (2013), use
stellar population (metallicities [Fe/H] and ages) and dynamical information to identify potentially
accreted globular clusters. Consider if there are some globular clusters that stand out in the agemetallicity relation or that do not rotate with the bulk of other globular clusters.
Consider what the above findings might mean for how the Milky Way formed and how many of its
globular clusters could be accreted and how many may have formed within the Milky Way. Consider
what further tests could be performed to delineate various possible formation scenarios.
